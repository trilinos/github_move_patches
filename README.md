# github_move_patches

This repo holds the patches that were used to clean up Trilinos after filtering
portions of it out for various reasons. These patches mostly fix up build
errors from the missing package directories. These patches were not applied to
every patch due to the differences in the state of the code, nor was every
branch made to work before the move to github. 

These patches are being provided as a starting point in case it becomes
necessary to support additional branches beyond those already updated. It would
be best to start with the patches to the branch closest to the branch you wish
to update.


The patches that have been applied to a branch will be in a directory with the
same name as the branch they were applied to. It is expected that there will be
duplication in these directories. That is acceptable to ensure it is obvious
which patches were used and easy to apply them to a close branch when needed.
